# [TRACK_TITLE] — Design Document

## Core Concept

**The Engine:** [What drives this track? The central metaphor or mechanism that powers the song.]

**The Hook:** [What makes this track distinctive? The unique angle, the thing that makes it stand out from other tracks on the album.]

**The Pattern:** [What recurring element defines the structure? The shape of the song — a loop, a build, a collapse, a cycle.]

**The Horror/Payoff:** [What's the emotional or thematic revelation? The gut-punch moment, the twist, or the quiet devastation.]

---

## Role on Album

**Differentiation from other tracks:**
- *[SIMILAR_TRACK_1]* = [How it differs from this track]
- *[SIMILAR_TRACK_2]* = [How it differs from this track]
- *[THIS_TRACK]* = [What makes THIS track unique]

**Sonic role:** [Where it fits in album dynamics — heavy moment, breathing room, transition, climax, etc.]

**Thematic role:** [What it contributes to album narrative — introduces theme, deepens it, subverts it, resolves it]

**Single potential:** [Yes/No — reasoning. Consider: hook strength, accessibility, radio-friendly structure, crossover appeal]

**Runtime target:** [X:XX-X:XX]
