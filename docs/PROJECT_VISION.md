When helping with lyrics, maintain:

*Example guidelines:*
- *"Sensory specificity over abstraction — show the oil on skin, not 'dark feelings'"*
- *"Narrator is complicit, not innocent — no clean hands"*
- *"Sexuality is charged but ambiguous — the reader's mind does the explicit work"*
- *"Repetition as hypnosis, not laziness — loops that create unease"*
