# Suno Album Template

A structured workflow template for producing full albums with [Suno AI](https://suno.com), designed to be used with Claude as your AI production partner.

## What This Is

A complete documentation framework that guides you from concept to finished album. Instead of generating tracks one-off, this template enforces a cohesive creative process — sonic identity, lyric development, prompt engineering, quality auditing, and release preparation.

Born from real album production experience, refined across multiple projects.

## The Workflow

```
Concept → PROJECT_VISION.md → Track Design → Suno-Ready Lyrics → Audit → Generate → Log Results
```

Each track goes through:
1. **Brainstorming** — One question at a time to develop the concept
2. **Design Document** — Full creative blueprint with structure, imagery, and connections
3. **Suno-Ready File** — Formatted lyrics with meta tags, style prompt, and slider recommendations
4. **Album Bible Update** — Track worksheet, status tracking, cross-references
5. **Audit** — Quality check against the full album before generation
